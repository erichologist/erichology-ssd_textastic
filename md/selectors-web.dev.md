# Selectors | web.dev


If you've got some text that you only want to be larger and red if it's the first paragraph of an article, how do you do that?

```css
<article>
  <p>I want to be red and larger than the other text.</p>
  <p>I want to be normal sized and the default color.</p>
</article>
```

You use a CSS selector to find that specific element and apply a CSS rule, like this.

```css
article p:first-of-type {
 color: red;
 font-size: 1.5em;
}
```

CSS provides you with a lot of options to select elements and apply rules to them, ranging from very simple to very complex, to help solve situations like this.

## The parts of a CSS rule

To understand how selectors work and their role in CSS, it's important to know the parts of a CSS rule. A CSS rule is a block of code, containing one or more selectors and one or more declarations.

In this CSS rule, the **selector** is `.my-css-rule` which finds all elements with a class of `my-css-rule` on the page. There are three declarations within the curly brackets. A declaration is a property and value pair which applies styles to the elements matched by the selectors. A CSS rule can have as many declarations and selectors as you like.

## Simple selectors

The most straightforward group of selectors target HTML elements plus classes, IDs, and other attributes which may be added to an HTML tag.

### Universal selector

A [universal selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors)—also known as a wildcard—matches any element.

```css
* {
 color: hotpink;
}
```

This rule causes every HTML element on the page to have hotpink text.

### Type selector

A [type selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors) matches a HTML element directly.

```css
section {
 padding: 2em;
}
```

This rule causes every `<section>` element to have `2em` of `padding` on all sides.

### Class selector

Browser Support

[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/Class_selectors)

A HTML element can have one or more items defined in their `class` attribute. The [class selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) matches any element that has that class applied to it.

```css
<div class="my-class"></div>
<button class="my-class"></button>
<p class="my-class"></p>
```

Any element that has the class applied to it will get colored red:

```css
.my-class {
 color: red;
}
```

Notice how the `.` is only present in CSS and **not** the HTML. This is because the `.` character instructs the CSS language to match class attribute members. This is a common pattern in CSS, where a special character, or set of characters, is used to define selector types.

A HTML element that has a class of `.my-class` will still be matched to the above CSS rule, even if they have several other classes, like this:

```css
<div class="my-class another-class some-other-class"></div>
```

This is because CSS looks for a `class` attribute that *contains* the defined class, rather than matching that class exactly.

**Note:**  The value of a class attribute can be almost anything you want it to be. One thing that could trip you up, is that you can't start a class (or an ID) with a number, such as `.1element`. You can read more [in the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#characters).  

### ID selector

Browser Support

* 1
* 1
[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/ID_selectors)

An HTML element with an `id` attribute should be the only element on a page with that ID value. You select elements with an [ID selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors) like this:

```css
#rad {
 border: 1px solid blue;
}
```

This CSS would apply a blue border to the HTML element that has an `id` of `rad`, like this:

```css
<div id="rad"></div>
```

Similarly to the class selector `.`, use a `#` character to instruct CSS to look for an element that matches the `id` that follows it.

**Note:**  If the browser encounters more than one instance of an `id` it will still apply any CSS rules that match its selector. However, any element that has an `id` attribute is supposed to have a unique value for it, so unless you're writing very specific CSS for a single element, avoid applying styles with the `id` selector as it means you can't re-use those styles elsewhere.  

### Attribute selector

Browser Support

[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/Attribute_selectors)

You can look for elements that have a certain HTML attribute, or have a certain value for an HTML attribute, using the [attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors). Instruct CSS to look for attributes by wrapping the selector with square brackets (`[ ]`).

```css
[data-type='primary'] {
 color: red;
}
```

This CSS looks for all elements that have an attribute of `data-type` with a value of `primary`, like this:

```css
<div data-type="primary"></div>
```

Instead of looking for a specific value of `data-type`, you can also look for elements with the attribute present, regardless of its value.

```css
[data-type] {
 color: red;
}
```

```css
<div data-type="primary"></div>
<div data-type="secondary"></div>
```

Both of these `<div>` elements will have red text.

You can use case-sensitive attribute selectors by adding an `s` operator to your attribute selector.

```css
[data-type='primary' s] {
 color: red;
}
```

This means that if a HTML element had a `data-type` of `Primary`, instead of `primary`, it would not get red text. You can do the opposite—case insensitivity—by using an `i` operator.

Along with case operators, you have access to operators that match portions of strings inside attribute values.

```css
/* A href that contains "example.com" */
[href*='example.com'] {
 color: red;
} /* A href that starts with https */
[href^='https'] {
 color: green;
} /* A href that ends with .com */
[href$='.com'] {
 color: blue;
}
```

In this demo, the \`$\` operator in our attribute selector gets the filetype from the \`href\` attribute. This makes it possible to prefix the label—based on that filetype—using a pseudo-element.

A selector doesn't have to match only a single element. You can group multiple selectors by separating them with commas:

```css
strong,
em,
.my-class,
[lang] {
 color: red;
}
```

This example extends the color change to both `<strong>` elements and `<em>` elements. It's also extended to a class named `.my-class`, and an element that has a `lang` attribute.

### Check your understanding

Test your knowledge of simple selectors

```css
* {}
```

What kind of simple selector is used in the above snippet?

`[]` are used for **attribute** simple selectors.

`#` are used for **ID** simple selectors.

`*` is the **universal** simple selector.

`.` are used for **class** simple selectors.

```css
div {}
```

What kind of simple selector is used in the above snippet?

A `.` is used for **class** simple selectors.

An `element` name is used for **type** simple selectors.

Square brackets `[]` are used for **attribute** simple selectors.

A `#` is used for **ID** simple selectors.

CSS provides useful selector types that focus on specific platform state, like when an element is hovered, structures *inside* an element, or parts of an element.

### Pseudo-classes

HTML elements find themselves in various states, either because they are interacted with, or one of their child elements is in a certain state.

For example, an HTML element could be hovered with the mouse pointer by a user *or* a child element could also be hovered by the user. For those situations, use the `:hover` pseudo-class.

```css
/* Our link is hovered */
a:hover {
 outline: 1px dotted green;
} /* Sets all even paragraphs to have a different background */
p:nth-child(even) {
 background: floralwhite;
}
```

Find out more in the [pseudo-classes module](https://web.dev/learn/css/pseudo-classes).

### Pseudo-element

Pseudo-elements differ from pseudo-classes because instead of responding to the platform state, they act as if they are inserting a new element with CSS. Pseudo-elements are also syntactically different from pseudo-classes, because instead of using a single colon (`:`), we use a double colon (`::`).

**Note:**  A double colon (`::`) is what distinguishes a pseudo-element from a pseudo-class, but because this distinction wasn't present in older versions of CSS specs, browsers support a single colon for the original pseudo-elements, such as `:before` and `:after` to help with backwards compatibility with older browsers, like IE8.  

```css
.my-element::before {
 content: 'Prefix - ';
}
```

As in the above demo where you prefixed a link's label with the type of file it was, you can use the `::before` pseudo-element to insert content **at the start of an element**, or the `::after` pseudo-element to insert content at the **end of an element**.

Pseudo-elements aren't limited to inserting content, though. You can also use them to target specific parts of an element. For example, suppose you have a list. Use `::marker` to style each bullet point (or number) in the list

```css
/* Your list will now either have red dots, or red numbers */
li::marker {
 color: red;
}
```

You can also use `::selection` to style the content that has been highlighted by a user.

```css
::selection {
 background: black;
 color: white;
}
```

### Check your understanding

Test your knowledge of pseudo selectors

Pseudo-element selectors use how many colons?

One `:` is used to target pseudo-classes.

Two `::` are used to target pseudo-elements.

This is invalid and targets nothing.

```css
p:hover {
 background: white;
 color: black;
}
```

What kind of pseudo selector is used in the above snippet?

One `:` is used to target pseudo-classes.

Two `::` are used to target pseudo-elements.

You have already seen a vast array of selectors, but sometimes, you will need more *fine-grained control* with your CSS. This is where complex selectors step in to help.

It's worth remembering at this point that although the following selectors give us more power, we can only **cascade downwards**, selecting child elements. We are not able to target upwards and select a parent element. We cover what the cascade is and how it works [in a later lesson](https://web.dev/learn/css/the-cascade).

### Combinators

A combinator is what sits between two selectors. For example, if the selector was `p > strong`, the combinator is the `>` character. The selectors which use these combinators help you select items based on their position in the document.

#### Descendant combinator

To understand descendant combinators, you need to first understand parent and child elements.

```css
<p>A paragraph of text with some <strong>bold text for emphasis</strong>.</p>
```

The parent element is the `<p>` which contains text. Inside that `<p>` element is a `<strong>` element, making its content bold. Because it is inside the `<p>`, it is a child element.

A descendant combinator allows us to target a child element. This uses a space ( ) to instruct the browser to look for child elements:

```css
p strong {
 color: blue;
}
```

This snippet selects all `<strong>` elements that are child elements of `<p>` elements only, making them blue recursively.

Because the descendant combinator is recursive, the padding added to each child element applies, resulting in a staggered effect.

This effect is better visualised in the above example, using the combinator selector, `.top div`. That CSS rule adds left padding to those `<div>` elements. Because the combinator is recursive, all `<div>` elements that are in `.top` will have that same padding applied to them.

Take a look at the HTML panel in this demo to see how the `.top` element has several `<div>` child elements which themselves, have `<div>` child elements.

#### Next sibling combinator

You can look for an element that immediately follows another element by using a `+` character in your selector.

To add space between stacked elements, use the next sibling combinator to add space *only* if an element is a **next sibling** of a child element of `.top`.

You could add margin to all child elements of `.top`, using the following selector:

```css
.top * {
 margin-top: 1em;
}
```

The problem with this is that because you're selecting every child element of `.top`, this rule potentially creates extra, unnecessary space. The **next sibling combinator**, mixed with a **universal selector** enables you to not only control what elements get space, but also apply space to **any element**. This provides you with some long-term flexibility, regardless of what HTML elements appear in `.top`.

A subsequent combinator is very similar to a next sibling selector. Instead of a `+` character however, use a `~` character. How this differs is that an element just has to follow another element with the same parent, rather than being the next element with the same parent.

Use a subsequent selector along with a \`:checked\` pseudo class to create a pure CSS switch element.

This subsequent combinator provides a little less rigidity, which is useful in contexts like the above sample, where we change the color of a custom switch when its associated checkbox has the `:checked` state.

#### Child combinator

A child combinator (also known as direct descendant) allows you more control over the recursion that comes with combinator selectors. By using the `>` character, you limit the combinator selector to apply **only** to direct children.

Consider the previous, next sibling selector example. The space is added to each **next sibling**, but if one of those elements also has **next sibling elements** as children, it can result in undesirable, extra spacing.

To alleviate this problem, change the **next sibling selector** to incorporate a child combinator: `> * + *`. The rule will now **only** apply to direct children of `.top`.

### Compound selectors

You can combine selectors to increase specificity and readability. For example, to target `<a>` elements, that also have a class of `.my-class`, write the following:

```css
a.my-class {
 color: red;
}
```

This wouldn't apply a red color to all links and it would also only apply the red color to `.my-class` **if** it was on an `<a>` element. For more on this, see the [specificity module](https://web.dev/learn/css/specificity).
